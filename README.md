# JavaExperiments

This repository will be used to implement some experiments, about **Object-Oriented concepts**, about **Java implementation and behavior**, and other interesting cases.

I will implement **JUnit Tests** to do this, so if you want to to these experiments from yourserf, you just has to execute them.

To help configuration, I'm using a **Maven Project**, so keep that in mind when you import it to your favority IDE (by the way, in using ***Eclipse***).
